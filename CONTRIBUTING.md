# Contributing

To encourage active collaboration, we strongly encourages pull requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Pull Requests

* One pull request per feature - If you want to do more than one thing, please send multiple pull requests.
* Coding Style - Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2), enforced by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io).
* Tests - Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.
* Coherent commit history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
* Conflicts - You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
* Update docs - If you are changing the behavior, or the public api, you may need to update the docs.
* Release cycle - We follow [SemVer](http://semver.org).

## Tests

If the test suite passes on your local machine you should be good to go. However when you make a pull request, the tests will automatically be run again by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org). We also have [StyleCI](https://styleci.io) setup to automatically fix any code style issues.
